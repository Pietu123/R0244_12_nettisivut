          <p>
            Probably the most common of “small complications,” this is simply a
            display of the date via a numbered disk that passes under an
            aperture in the dial, usually positioned at 3 o’clock, 4:30, or 6
            o’clock. Unless the watch is an annual or perpetual calendar, this
            date will need to be manually adjusted forward at the end of any
            month shorter than 31 days. Some watches, like the Rolex Submariner,
            enlarge this display by placing a magnifying lens over the window.

        <div class="col border bg-white">
          <h2 class="mt-4 mb-3">Annual calendar</h2>

          <p>
            The most sophisticated type of calendar watch, a perpetual calendar
            is endowed with a mechanical “memory” that enables it to display the
            time, day, date, month, and often the moon-phase, accurately for
            many years. The complex movement in a perpetual calendar compensates
            for the length of every month, including February in both leap years
            and non-leap-years, meaning that it should not need adjusting until
            the year 2100, which is the next annum in which the Gregorian
            calendar’s leap-year cycle is disrupted: it will be the first year
            since 1900 that is exactly divisible by 100 but not by 400, and thus
            not a leap year. In rare instances, as in the Patek Philippe
            reference pictured above, a perpetual calendar can be combined with
            other complications like a chronograph for an even higher level of
            horological savoir faire.

          <h2 class="mt-4 mb-3">GMT/Dual Time</h2>

          <p>
            GMT stands for Greenwich Mean Time, and a GMT watch is one that
            allows its wearer to read the time in (at least) two different time
            zones simultaneously. Most often, they do so with the use of a
            second hour hand and a 24-hour scale on the bezel or dial. A useful
            timepiece for frequent travelers, its main hour hand can be adjusted
            to point to the local time while the wearer is abroad, while the
            additional hour hand, usually designed to be distinct from the main
            one, points to the time at home, or “reference time,” on the 24-hour
            scale whose numerals correspond to the world’s time zones as
            established by the Greenwich Meridian. A GMT watch whose 24-hour
            bezel is rotatable can add a third time zone reading via the main
            hour hand.

          <h2 class="mt-4 mb-3">Tourbillon</h2>

          <p>
            Not really a complication by the strictest meaning of the term, as
            it doesn’t add an additional function to the timekeeping, a
            tourbillon is nevertheless held up as an example of elite
            horological technology and watches equipped with them are highly
            prized and almost invariably pricey. Patented by Abraham-Louis
            Breguet in 1801, the tourbillon (French for "whirlwind") was a
            device designed to compensate for the ill effects of gravitational
            pull on a watch movement's accuracy by placing the balance and
            escapement inside a rotating cage that made a 360º revolution every
            minute. While its gravity-defying functionality is less important in
            a relatively mobile wristwatch than in a mostly stationary pocket
            watch, the tourbillon's balletic motions make a luxury watch come to
            mesmerizing life when it is displayed through a dial aperture, as it
            is in the vast majority of timepieces that include it today,
            including the Breguet watch above.
