          <p>
            Rolex SA is a Swiss watch designer and manufacturer based in Geneva,
            Switzerland. Founded in 1905 as Wilsdorf and Davis by Hans Wilsdorf
            and Alfred Davis in London, the company registered Rolex as the
            brand name of its watches in 1908 and became Rolex Watch Co. Ltd. in
            1915. After World War I, the company moved its base of operations to
            Geneva because of the unfavorable economy in the United Kingdom. In
            1920, Hans Wilsdorf registered Montres Rolex SA in Geneva as the new
            company name (montre is French for clock or watch); it later became
            Rolex SA. Since 1960, the company has been owned by the Hans
            Wilsdorf Foundation, a private family trust. Rolex SA and its
            subsidiary Montres Tudor SA design, make, distribute, and service
            wristwatches sold under the Rolex and Tudor brands. In 2023 Rolex
            agreed to acquire its longtime retail partner Bucherer.

          <p>
            Omega SA is a Swiss luxury watchmaker based in Biel/Bienne,
            Switzerland. Founded by Louis Brandt in La Chaux-de-Fonds in 1848,
            the company formerly operated as La Generale Watch Co. until
            incorporating the name Omega in 1903, becoming Louis Brandt et
            Frère-Omega Watch & Co. In 1984, the company officially changed its
            name to Omega SA and opened its museum in Biel/Bienne to the public.
            Omega is a subsidiary of The Swatch Group. Britain's Royal Flying
            Corps used Omega watches in 1917 for its combat units, followed by
            the U.S. Army in 1918, and NASA in 1969 for Apollo 11. Omega has
            been the official timekeeper of the Olympics since 1932 and is the
            current timekeeper of the America's Cup yacht race. Omega was a main
            partner of the 2022 Winter Olympics.

          <p>
            Audemars Piguet Holding SA is a Swiss manufacturer of ultra luxury
            watches, headquartered in Le Brassus, Switzerland. The company was
            founded by Jules Louis Audemars and Edward Auguste Piguet in the
            Vallée de Joux in 1875, acquiring the name Audemars Piguet & Cie in
            1881. The company has been family-owned since its founding. The
            company is best known for introducing the Royal Oak wristwatch in
            1972, which helped the brand rise to prominence within the
            watchmaking industry. One of its earlier achievements was creating
            the first minute-repeating movement in 1892. The company developed
            the first skeleton watch in 1934 and has manufactured some of the
            thinnest watches, such as the 1986 ultra-thin automatic tourbillon
            wristwatch (Calibre 2870).
